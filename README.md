# ModernStickies

Simple program that patches the Stickies.app binary to change default sticky note colors.

It works on my machine, but it may not work on your machine. Or with your version of the Stickies.app.

I tested it on OS X 10.12.1, with Stickies.app Version 10.0 (1000).

If you decide to use it - make a backup copy.

### Usage

Stickies.app is part of OS X distribution. It means that there us no way you
can modify, rename, or delete the app.

I recommend to make a copy of the app, call it `Modern Stickies.app`, and then
simply run `make patch`.

Open the Modern Stickies.app and voil√†:
